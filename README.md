# TensorFlowLite-Sample Android

This is a sample app I made to test TensorFlow and it's counterpart TensorFlow-Lite library, to see how well the app would handle the tasks I want to perform.

## Model
The included model in the assets directory is a basic image classification model which has been taken from this [codelab](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/image_classification/overview). The dataset used contained 2 categories of chest x rays, one of patients which were Covid19 Positive and the other were standard chest x rays of patients who were either normal or had any disease apart from Covid19.
The normal data set has been taken from [this kaggle listing](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) while the Covid19 Positive data set has been taken from [this github repository](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)
